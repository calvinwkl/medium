# "I have an idea and want to make an app. How do I start?" - A list of answers to this question.



Many people had their app ideas in their mind, but yet to execute. Some might lack directions of how to actually get things started. Some might just don’t know if they can get things started. I am writing down a list of questions and answers below and I hope those can help you to solve some of the questions in your mind. The list will be updated if there is a need.
> **Q: I am not a programmer, nor I had any experience to coding. Can I still make apps? (iOS/Android)**

A: You can. Everyone can. Of course it is provided that you have basic logic thinking. You often see people working in the IT industry, but their education backgrounds are not necessarily from related subjects. The hard thing for those people is, at the start, getting used to the terms we often say and the tools that we often used. However, these can all be overcame by keep using, keep thinking and keep asking. It all comes down to your dedication.
> **Q: I understand and I will learn to code. How do I start?**

A: Go find some coding tutorial online for beginners. After you have some basic understandings of any programming language, you will be good to read any online materials for starter and my future stories. In this story, I will not write any code.

> **Q: How do I start Android programming? What is needed to get started?**

A: You have to use either **Java **or** Kotlin **to code **native** android app. Here comes the first terms, **native**. There are many ways to make android or ios app. The most basic approach is using the official languages, Java or Kotlin. You may have also known **React Native **and** Flutter**, which are not using Java nor Kotlin, but also **native. **Had this in mind and I will talk about this in future.

***Java/Kotlin** : **Native** Android Programming Language*

***IDE** : Integrated Development Environment (the tools you use to write code)*

***Android Studio** : Official IDE for Android programming*

The IDE you will use is [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/). You can run on both Windows and Mac. Go download it and get the feel and click around.
> **Q: How do I start iOS programming?**

A: You have to use either **Objective-C **or** Swift **to code **native** iOS app. Although you can do both, **I** **strongly recommended you to start iOS programming with Swift**. It is easier for newbie as well as veteran. Swift is open-source, easier to understand, preferred by Apple and more and more that not to be disclosed here. **Objective-C **still has its reason of existence. But us, ordinary iOS developer, do not need to care about that.

***open-source **: when we say a thing is open sourced, it means: its source code is open to public, clear to everyone, constantly maintained by developers from worldwide and hence trustworthy*
> **Q: Do I need to get a Mac or iPhone for iOS development?**

A: **A Mac is inevitably needed.** iMac, Macbook Air or Mac mini or whatever Mac you like, a Mac is needed. You might see some teach online that you can install **MacOS** in your Windows, or anything that can make your [**Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)** work without a Mac, trust me, it is just not worth your time to do it. It requires tedious work and time. You better put those effort into your ideas.

***MacOS **: the name of Operation System for Mac (just like Windows)*

***Xcode** : Official IDE for iOS programming (iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch)*

***iOS Simulator** : A virtual device for you to run in your Mac (run by Xcode)*

Luckily, an iPhone/iPad is not necessarily needed. You can develop **most of features** with the **iOS Simulator** (includes iPhone and iPad). If you do not ever need to touch these remaining features, you do not need an iPhone for development!

*Real device needed features: Push Notifications, SMS, Mail etc.*
> **Q: Do I need to pay for putting my app to App Store or Google Play?**

A: Yes. Google Play is a life-time fee $25. App Store is $100 per year.

*Reminder:*

* *both prices are subject to change and in USD*

* *You DO NOT need to pay for coding and development.*

* *You can pay the fee until you are going to launch the app, say near production stage*
> **Q: Any programming books do you recommend?**

I do not have any preference. I am sure that you can find a lot materials from Google without buying any books. But one thing I want to point out is: if you want to buy books, don’t buy hard copy ones. Technology advances faster than you can think of. Buy eBooks, so that you can receive updates regularly, and also be environmentally friendly.

I will keep update the FAQ list if I think of some more. Stay tuned for more upcoming stories.
